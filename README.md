# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project was to use a dataset of historical lending activity from a lending services company to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. The records in the dataset each have loan status that determine whether its a risky or healthy loan. This status is decided by the other variables in the dataset which are the loan size, interest rate, borrower's income, debt to income ration, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. We first seperate the dependent and independent variables and then split the data into training and testing sets. Then we create a logistic regression model with the data to make our predictin and then do the same with then resampled training data
